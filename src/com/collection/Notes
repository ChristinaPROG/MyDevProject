What are servers:
1) Power stays on all the time.
2) Strong internet connection(in GBps) all the time.
3)A lot of resources like Ram disk ect
=================================================================

 code and deploy the code on Dev servers
3) Developer verifies that code on Dev server

Issues in the manual Testing/Deployment

1)Time Consuming
2) If multiple developers are working there can be issues in build and to fix those issues we may
need to look all of the newly added code
3)No automation means alot of manual effort
